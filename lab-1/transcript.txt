Hey guys, good morning. It's Mike Chen
here in Austin, Texas. I've been in
Austin a few days now. I came here
mainly because I wanted to try the
barbecue scene in the surrounding areas,
which has been absolutely mind-blowing.
And I also saw there has been a lot of
Chinese noodle and dumpling places that
popped up. And one in particular caught
my attention because back in Washington,
I found what I think might just be the
best soup dumpling in all of North
America. And I just realized that it's
actually a chain that started here in
Austin. So, I'm going to head over there
and try out their original location. But
since it's still early, I have some work
to do on my laptop and I'm starving. I
just got some breakfast using the
sponsor of this video, Door Dash. Door
Dash is something I use a lot,
especially during those days or
especially late nights where there's no
food in my house. That's where Door Dash
comes in. And if you don't know, Door
Dash is an online delivery app that
makes getting food fast, easy, and
reliable. Your door, in my case, this
morning, I got some biscuits and gravy
from this really popular diner. And
depending on your area and the time of
day, orders can arrive in as little as
20 to 35 minutes, which is extremely
important when you're starving. I think
my order today has taken around 30
minutes. Also, what's great is that
everything is sealed. It's tracked,
delivered through Door Dash from
checkout all the way to your door. And
as soon as your order is picked up, you
get a photo. Like, I just see a photo
right now with my order in it telling me
that my food is picked up and on the
way. Also, you may not know, but Door
Dash is not just about restaurants
anymore. You can also get groceries,
snacks, wellness essentials, household
items, pet supplies, gifts, and more all
in one place. Let's say you're cooking,
you forgot an ingredient, or you're not
feeling well and don't want to make
another store run. Many of those orders
can arrive in as little as 30 minutes
depending on your location. And if you
use Door Dash a lot, Dash Pass is the
move. It's a membership that gets you
zero delivery fees and reduced service
fees on eligible orders, plus membership
exclusive perks. And the best thing is
there's a 30-day free trial for eligible
users, so you can try it out. You can
also pause or cancel anytime. So, if
you're interested, I'll have the link
available for you in the description box
below. Oh, I just got a message that the
Dasher is nearby. Be right back.
This is awesome. Biscuit and gravy.
M.
Check this out. So, this is a cool
little little shopping retail area. I
think I was here last time just kind of
walking around. I'm I'm here now because
I wanted to go to Dumpling World because
there's a Dumpling World in Washington
where I think it's the best soup
dumpling in all of North America. I
think it's the same Dumpling World here.
So, I wanted to check it out. There's
actually a couple of dumpling noodle
places in this little plaza. This is the
other one, Min and Bao. There's actually
a ton of noodle dumpling places here in
Austin. I think we should check a bunch
of them out. Starting with this one.
This place has some pretty traditional
Chinese dishes like spicy cold jelly
noodles, which I love. They also have
like katsu. The soup dumplings from the
photos look pretty legit, I got to say.
There's also shi. So, there's dim sum,
too. The spicy beef noodle looks good.
Doesn't look like it's too big of a
portion either. All right. got dumpling
and noodle. So, I didn't get the
traditional um beef noodle soups. This
is something you don't see a lot in
Chinese restaurant. This is called lean.
So, this is a Chinese jelly jelly
noodle, and it's made from mine flour.
It's not going to have much of a chew,
but the flavor and texture is excellent.
Not bad. This is a very traditional
Chinese noodle dish. Very delicate
noodles.
I haven't had this in such a long time.
And that's why I wanted some
lots of garlic, chilies, vinegar, some
peanuts in here. That's pretty good.
This is going to go very well with my
dumplings. My soup dumpling just got
here. First impression, these are going
to be pretty juicy soup dumplings. The
skin might be a little on the thicker
side, but let's see. Did they bring over
some vinegar, ginger? Oh, wow. Oh, these
are going to be very juicy. You can
already tell there's a lot of juice in
here.
Oo. Okay, there is tons of juice in
here. Oh. Oh, it's more than a spoonful.
Oh, it's more than a spoonful. There's
still juice in here. It's already a full
spoon of juice.
It's not bad. It's a little on the
sweeter side.
It's a solid dump. I don't particularly
like
my dumplings sweet at all,
but it is a very juicy, scrumptious
dumpling. I mean, it might be a little
thick on the top.
The bottom and sides are not thick at
all.
The filling is solid. The texture of the
pork filling is marvelous. It breaks
apart in your mouth just the way I
expect soup dumplings to. Goes pretty
well with my jelly noodles.
I say a solid eight on my soup dumpling
scale
for me. If they cut the sweetness in
half, this would be a solid nine, nine
and a half soup dumpling. Basically,
you're not going to go wrong if you get
soup dumpling in here. I could easily
eat another basket of this. Pretty good.
All right, this is the other thing I
wanted to try. So, these are shimzen
ball or fried pork buns. Still, these
are going to be nice and toasty on the
bottom. I feel like this thing has a
reservoir of shoes inside as well.
Oh, yeah. I feel like this should come
with a warning label cuz if you just
straight up bite into this, I think it
could be a disaster.
Yeah, there's juice. Like, I'm just
biting into it a little bit, I could
tell it's full of juice.
I be really careful with this. Oh, yeah.
See this? I just nibbled the top. You
guys see all the juice that's in here?
This thing is loaded with juice. This is
all juice. Almost to the top. Filled
with juice.
Big old piece of pork filling inside.
You got to bite and slurp this
or else it could actually burn you. This
thing has so much juice inside. See,
look at this. This is no joke, man.
This is probably one of the juiciest
versions of this dish I've ever had.
I think the same thing I'll say about
this as I said about the soup dumpling.
It's a little on the sweeter side. And
that's personal preference. I know this
is Shanghai food. A lot of people in
Shanghai like sweeter things. So, if you
like dumplings a little on the sweeter
side, then this will be right up your
alley. This is very nice. I think I
might prefer this over the soup
dumplings.
And after this, the place I originally
was was here for right across the
street. On to the next spot, Dumpling
World. Okay, I'm pretty sure this is the
location that opened a new restaurant in
Washington. I think it's the same place.
Okay.
Don't world. I swear to goodness, like
I've been all around the US. Washington
is the most expensive state for food.
More expensive than LA. More expensive
than New York City. The soup dumplings
here is $12.95. Pretty reasonable. Soup
dumpling in Washington. Same restaurant.
I think it was like $15. Okay, these
soup dumplings look legit. These taste
like what I had in Washington. I'm
telling you guys, these are the best
soup dumplings in North America. First
of all, I got this dish once in
Washington. This is really good. This is
an eggplant noodle with fresh garlic on
top with hand pulled noodles on the
bottom. Hand pulled wide noodles on the
bottom. Look at this. This is beautiful.
And this is chunks of eggplant and
minced pork in here. Look at these soup
dumplings. First thing you notice, you
can see right through them. I mean,
these wrappers are ridiculously thin.
You can see the soup inside each
dumpling. Yeah, this is a very thin thin
wrapper. I mean, this wrapper is so
see-through. If you were the parents of
these dumplings, you'd tell it to go and
pour more dough on. Look at that.
Beautiful. Beautiful thin skin. Tons of
juice in here.
Like I always do, I like to pour the
juice out in a spoon just to see how
much juice in here. Pretty good amount
of soup.
Oh, yeah.
This is the stuff. Chinese black
vinegar. This is what you want in your
soup dumpling. Chinese black vinegar.
Hot oil. Add a little bit. You don't
want to go crazy,
you know, not too much. A little bit of
hot oil is enough. Add the vinegar and
chilies into the soup dumpling itself.
And then pop the whole thing in your
mouth.
Yeah, this is totally my type of soup
dumplings.
Every time you bite down, it's a whole
mouthful of dumpling soup. One of the
best soup dumplings you'll find
anywhere.
This is one of the best sudumps you'll
find in North America, if not the best
for me. Perfect wrapper. Nice and chewy.
Ginormous pork filling inside. Tons of
soup. It's everything I want in a soup
dumpling. It is.
That's really so good. That disappeared
way too quickly. All right, let's try
these noodles. So, there are some
differences between this restaurant and
what I had in Washington. The noodles in
Washington they use I don't know if
they're freshly made noodles. They're
the thinner noodles. These look more
like hand pulled noodles.
They taste more like hand pull noodles,
too. I think this dish is way better
here.
This dish is better here. Usually I will
prefer the beef noodle soup, but I would
highly recommend this dish with the
eggplant.
That is really scrumptious
eggplant and fatty little pieces of
pork. I wasn't going to get these, but
the person who was working here really
insisted on me trying this. So, this is
the same thing I got at the last place.
Fried buns. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You can
tell this thing is also just filled to
the top with juice.
Oh. Oh my gosh. Oh, I couldn't even put
this down like flat. Hang on. Hang on. I
got to somehow move this into my plate.
Took a little nibble at the top. And as
soon as I put it down Oh, look. The
juice is just trying to ooze out. I
wanted to just kind of nibble the top so
I can see how much juice in here, but
I'm going to have to pour some of this
juice out.
Oh, so much juice in here. Like an
incredible amount. It's like a porky
geyser. Oh man, that is not good. Not
good at all. Okay, so a bunch of the
juice fell out. And even with the leaked
out juice, you can see that this
ginormous porky filling inside, it's
just swimming
in juice.
Oh man. Oh my gosh.
M. Oh, it's boiling hot. You really got
to be so careful with this
crispy bottom. Gigantic filling.
It's so so good. You know what they say,
the chance that you'll be injured by a
dumpling is pretty low, but it's not
zero. Wow, this is so good. The noodles
are so much better here in Texas. You
guys got it all in Texas. Seriously,
cheaper price and a better noodle. I
think I have to do this. Definitely
ready to take a break. See you guys for
dinner.
One last dumpling meal today. This place
looks really authentic. First thing I
noticed about this place is look how big
the chug of hot oil is. Yeah, it's
definitely my kind of place. And soup
dumplings here is the cheapest I've seen
today. $10.99 for eight soup dumplings.
Look at that price. Everything's freshly
made, handmade. This is a gem of a
place. And beef noodle soup for $13. I
think I'm really going to like this
place. Okay, my first dish got here.
This smells really good. So, this is
Wow. salivating.
Ah, this is their toothpick lamb. So,
these are little chunks of lamb skewered
by toothpicks
and cooked in chilies and cumin and more
chilies. Look at this. It's basically
little skewers of lamb. This is a very,
very popular Chinese dish. This smells
pretty darn wonderful. You got to be
careful eating this, though. Stab
yourself.
Oh, it's good. No giness. Wow.
This thing is spicy. They are not joking
around with this dish. Even for me, this
is like solid 7 and 1/2. Borderline
eight out of 10 on the heat meter. You
know, for food that's not a spicy food
challenge.
Wow. Spicy.
M.
That's good. And lamb is good because
it's nice and fatty. So, this thing is
going to be pretty tender.
Wow.
That's really addictive. But I'm going
to get no relief either cuz the noodle
dish I got is pretty spicy as well.
M. Thank you. Wow. Thank you. Oh my
gosh. When you look at this from above,
it feels like you're staring down to the
mouth of a volcano. Look at this thing.
Look how spicy this thing looks. Good
lord. Wo. Okay. Giant chunks of beef.
Noodles are thin. These don't look like
homemade noodles. Pretty nice. Solid,
tender looking pieces of beef. And the
noodle soup I got is the Sutron style,
so it's nummy and spicy. It looks pretty
gnarly.
Oh, thank you so much. Okay, this is
delicious. The broth is delicious. My
soup dumplings just arrived. Hang on.
Let me slurp some noodles first.
Wow, this is an aggressively flavored
bowl of spicy beef noodle soup. If you
you're not into the mild flavor, the
mild soup, you're into just like a like
a karate kick to the throat kind of
flavor, this is for you.
Wow.
Okay.
To me, this flavor is perfect. I'm so
glad I got this option. There was an
option to just get spicy and not numb or
get spicy and nummy. I'm so happy I got
this. I can feel the numbummy tingle on
my tongue right now.
Wow.
Oh, that's some melt in your mouth.
Tender pieces of beef.
Wow.
Noodle texture is pretty good.
Wow. This is delicious. All right. This
is really delicious, bro.
I mean, it's going to hurt you, but
you'll thank it for the pain. Let's get
some hot oil. So, I got some ginger.
Look at this giant
tub of hot oil. What? Look at this. Just
add a little bit of hot oil.
Not too much. Little bit. For me, I
don't need soy sauce. I just need some
vinegar. Soup dumplings. Oh, this is
really, really delicate skin. It
definitely doesn't have as much soup as
the other dumplings I've had today. Dunk
it in here. Oh, comes out beautiful
looking.
Oh, that skin is delicate. It's a really
thin, really soft skin. You can see the
soup inside. It's not a huge quantity of
soup, but you can also tell this is the
type of soup dumpling that once you take
a bite of it, the soup is going to
explode.
Mhm.
It doesn't look like there's a lot of
soup in there. There's a lot of soup in
there. It's just kind of concentrated
inside that meat filling. I'm a big fan
of the chili oil there. The soup is kind
of coming out.
That is a good amount of soup.
I'm a I'm a fan of the chili oil.
M.
It's a good soup dumpling. A really
tasty soup dumpling.
Wow. Again, not as much soup as the ones
I had earlier today,
but everything from dumpling skin
to the filling. Everything dissolves on
contact, which to me is a very good
thing. It's It's a solid soup dumpling.
You can tell it's freshly made. I like
the skin. I think the skin is the
thinnest of all the soup dumplings I've
had today. My gosh. I'm just like one
bite of these.
And the flavor is my type of flavor.
Very savory, very porky. Plus, the price
I really like, too. Eight of these for
10 bucks.
That's a good price. Really solid soup
dumplings. I really like this beef
noodle soup. Highly recommend coming and
trying the spicy beef noodle soup. Not
not just the I don't know how they
worded it on the menu, but one of them
is just spicy and not numb. Get the
nummy one. Trust me, pure flavor.
Add some Chinese vinegar to this.
That's going to make it even better.
It is. It definitely did. Wow.
What a good day.
A day full of noodles and dumplings.
It's always a good day. There's just one
more place I want to try in the Austin
area. So, we'll try that tomorrow. See
you then.
Good morning. So, this next place I'm
going to, this is I
don't understand it,
but I got to try it. It's a noodle and
sushi place. Like, I never seen that
before. Chinese noodles and sushi.
So, not only have I never been to a
Chinese noodle and sushi place before, I
never been to a Chinese noodle and sushi
place buffet before because every day
all you can eat lunch. Check this out.
This is so crazy. It's hand pole noodles
and fresh cut sushi. What a combination.
Never seen that combination before in my
life. There's also soup dumplings. I
wonder what you get
um in the all you can eat. So, you
definitely get the noodles and you
definitely get sushi. I don't know if
you get like soup dumplings or what. Can
I do the soup dumplings, please?
Um,
man, this is so much stuff.
There is a lot of stuff. Six page menu.
Spicy shredded potatoes, please.
Yeah.
Oh, you got spicy lobster dumplings.
Those are really good.
Yes, please. Thank you. I don't know why
this place is not just out of door. This
might be if this tastes good. This might
be and sushi sushimi. It's going to
taste good. This might be the greatest
all you can eat experience ever. Like
this is all my favorite stuff. Chinese
noodles and dumplings. This is my
favorite things. And you get sushi.
Unbelievable. 24 $24.95.
This should be like 50 bucks easy,
right? Sushi. Sushimi scallops. Lobster
dumplings.
I don't know why people in Austin are
not just storming this place like people
storming
Frankenstein's castle or something with,
you know, instead of pitchforks, just
regular forks.
My noodles just got here. Handmade
freaking noodles. This looks and smells
so good. Look at this. Look how Oh, look
how spicy this thing is. Oh, there is so
much chilis in here. Thick slices of
beef, some bok choy.
Oh, look at these noodles. Just swimming
in this red volcanic looking broth. I'll
tell you right now, this is going to be
good. I'll tell you right now, it smells
super legit.
How can you go wrong
with freshly tempos?
It's the most amazing texture. Wow.
Noodles are perfect. Beef,
nice and tender.
There's so much flavor in this. You
taste the garlic, so much chilies, nice
crunchy sprouts and veg. The beef is
amazing. And man, they know what they're
doing. They brought over some Chinese
vinegar. You got to add this to any
noodle soup. Freaking outstanding. Let's
try this spicy shredded potatoes.
Everything is spicy. Everything is ultra
scrumptious.
This got to be one of my favorite food
experiences in Austin.
Some of my sushi has arrived. My lean
pee has arrived. Let me finish my dandan
noodles first.
So good.
Now let's try the lean pee. So this is
more like like chopped up lean pee.
Not bad.
It kind of tastes like stirfry lean pee.
My lobster dumpling just arrived. Check
this out. So, it's fried dumpling. A
little jalapeno on top. Oh, guac on the
bottom. Interesting.
M.
Oh, this is good. Inside. Shredded
lobster meat. Nice and tender and spicy.
I think I see the recurring theme here.
There's a lot of heat in these dishes.
That is good.
Soup dumplings just got here. Oh. Oh,
they're juicy.
Oh, so tender. Okay, I got to just kind
of slurp this whole thing because this
is not going to it's not going to
survive my chopsticks. All right,
Chinese vinegar, hot oil that goes in as
well. So, the soup dumplings they make
at their other location. So, this is all
homemade stuff. That's so juicy.
It's so juicy.
Like almost two mouthfuls of juice.
Wow, man. My mouth's on fire. I'm
sweating.
This is about as much fun as you can
have at a restaurant.
Seriously, look at how juicy these
dumplings are. It's like sitting in his
own swimming pool of broth.
Now, let's get to the sushi parts. So,
this is some tuna with some cucumbers
and seaweed.
Wa! Pure tuna. Oh, you can taste that
smoke. I mean, what can you say?
Everything is so good. It's got my beef
noodle soup with the handmade noodles.
This smells really, really awesome.
Definitely the broth is a lot lighter.
This is just a beef broth. Nothing in
here. No chilies, no vinegar.
Oh, it's nice.
Nice and light. I personally
like my broth
pretty aggressively seasoned. So, add
some vinegar. Add some chili oil.
That's definitely more my speed.
Fresh temple noodles.
There's not many things in the world
better than that.
I think overall the dandan noodles were
definitely more my style. My beef is
still turned up.
Now, let's get to the sushi. Seared
scallops. Like this stuff. This stuff is
expensive.
M.
Oh, it's tender.
That's so tender.
So perfect. Usually this stuff is not
going to be included. I mean, if you can
find giant scallops included in a buffet
at 24 bucks,
you know you're getting a good deal.
Check this out. Yellow tail jalapeno.
Melts in your mouth.
It's so buttery. Oh my gosh. And look at
this
fresh sashimi. I cannot believe this is
included. Especially this. Are you
kidding me? I mean, just including the
giant scallops is already phenomenal.
But including a sweet shrimp, that stuff
is not cheap. Start off piece of tuna.
That's yummy. Next, this is smoked
salmon.
Oh my gosh.
Might be unpopular opinion.
I usually like salmon more than tuna.
Surf clam. like a ginormous surf plant,
too.
And now the pinnacle scallops
and the sweet shrimp.
Wow. Wow. Oh, this is some premium
quality scallops.
Wow. Probably one of the sweetest things
from the ocean you can put in your
mouth. Wow. It's amazing. And then this,
this is such a premium ingredient.
Sweet shrimp.
Fresh sweet shrimp.
Oh,
just as sweet as the scallops.
More buttery. It's confirmed. This is
one of the most delicious value for
money all you can experiences
in the world. I'll say that. In the
world. Where else are you going to find
a place that gives you hemp pole
noodles, homemade dumplings, fresh
sushi, sashimi, and not just the cheap
stuff, not just like the California
rolls and whatever, scallops and sweet
shrimp. You're not going to find that
anywhere for $24.95.
You won't find it anywhere. Anywhere. I
almost didn't come here today. I was
trying to narrow down between two um
noodle restaurants. I'm so glad I came
here. Hey, man. This is so great. Thank
you so much.
Oh, that's great. That's another place
that if I lived in Austin, I'd be there
all the time. What a great deal. What
great food. People are so nice as well.
Yeah, highly recommend for that place. I
always love doing dumpling and noodle
tours, and that was the ultimate grand
finale. As always, all please winter
list down below for you guys. Thank you
all so much for watching. until we eat
again.
